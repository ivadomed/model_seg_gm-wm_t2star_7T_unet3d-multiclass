# model_seg_gm-wm_t2star_7T_unet3d-multiclass
Spinal cord and gray matter multiclass segmentation at 7T - T2Star 

This model has been trained on 7T MRI data in the Center for Magnetic Resonance in Biology and Medicine CRMBM-CEMEREM UMR 7339 Aix-Marseille University). 
Model was trained with ivadomed, segment the spinal cord and gray matter using deep learning. The convolutional neural network was trained on 7T T2*-weighted images from CRMBM-CEMEREM, and including various pathologies (HC, MS, ALS).
